        <h1>Midnight Studios releases Season 0 for SS2022</h1>
        <br>
        <i>Written by Hans Baumgartner 03/18/2022</i>
        <hr>
        <br>
        <p>
          Shane Gonzales brought Midnight Studios back to life with the brands
          first ever runway collection for SS2022. The collection was released
          February 10th at his show in Los Angeles, and became available for
          purchase February 17th. This release is noticealy his most
          sophisticated to date as he effortlesslt synchronizes streetwear and
          elegance. Shane is known for his heavy incorporation of the 60's
          through 70's rock/punk aesthetic. In this release, he is influenced by
          Pink Floyd's melodic dark style and is seen with use of their classic
          single 'welcome to the time machine' in many of their pieces. Our
          personal favorite piece was the classic british unifromed pants. He
          uses classic british rock influence to create innovative pieces.

          Our personal favorite's blended raw streetwear with sleek futuristic
